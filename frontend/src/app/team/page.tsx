  Home Page

  The home page of Tapestry is designed to be simple and easy to navigate. The top of the page features calendar where you can go back to previously populated dates, the first being 4/21/24. Below the calendar, you will find the top 5 articles of the day, which are ranked in descending order based on the number of sources that report on them. The articles are displayed in a card format, with the headline and a brief summary of the article. Clicking on the card will take you to the full article.

  Article Page

  The article page is broken into two sections: the Universally Agreed section and the Sources section. The Universally Agreed section is filled with information the LLM has determined to be reported in all of the different categories, whereas each source section contains information that is unique to the source or the source highlights more compared to the others.

  The script and prompt that popoulates the article page can be found here.
